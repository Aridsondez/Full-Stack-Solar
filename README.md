# Solar Energy Monitoring and Analysis System

## Project Overview
This project involves building a system to monitor and analyze solar energy production and consumption. The system will simulate data, process it using advanced analytics, and visualize it through an interactive dashboard. This project is designed to help you gain experience with technologies commonly used at NextEra Energy's EverBright.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Django, Django Rest Framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Front-End**: Angular with Chart.js/D3.js
- **APIs**: REST APIs for data communication
- **Visualization**: Tableau/Power BI (optional)

## Timeline


## Steps to Start
1. **Create a Repository**:
   - Initialize a new GitHub repository.
2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install Python and necessary libraries (`Django`, `Django Rest Framework`, `Pandas`, etc.).
   - Install Angular and set up the front-end environment.
   - Set up a local database (PostgreSQL).
3. **Plan the Architecture**:
   - Design the database schema.
   - Define API endpoints and front-end components.


### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup (1-2 Weeks)**
#### January 29 - February 11
1. Define project scope and core features.
2. Install necessary tools and set up your development environment:
   - Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework for backend development.
   - PostgreSQL/MySQL for database management.
   - Angular for front-end development.
3. Create a GitHub repository to track progress.

### **Phase 2: Data Simulation and Backend Development (4 Weeks)**
#### February 12 - March 10
1. **Data Simulation**:
   - Use Python to generate solar energy data (e.g., energy generated, weather conditions).
   - Save data to a local database using PostgreSQL.
2. **Backend API Development**:
   - Design RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework for fetching data (e.g., `/api/energy-stats`).
   - Implement endpoints for production, consumption, and alerts.
3. **Cloud Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend to AWS, GCP, or Azure (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2, or Elastic Beanstalk).

### **Phase 3: Front-End Development (4 Weeks)**
#### March 11 - April 7
1. Build an interactive dashboard using Angular:
   - Fetch data from the backend APIs.
   - Visualize data using Chart.js or D3.js (e.g., production trends, efficiency metrics).
2. Implement features for:
   - Real-time alerts for anomalies.
   - Historical data visualization.
3. Test the front-end thoroughly with sample data.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (4 Weeks)**
#### April 8 - May 5
1. Add predictive analytics using Python (e.g., scikit-learn or TensorFlow):
   - Predict solar energy production based on weather conditions.
2. Implement individual solar panel monitoring:
   - Simulate real-time data for multiple panels.
   - Visualize individual panel performance.
3. Add notifications via email/SMS using Twilio or AWS SNS.

### **Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (2 Weeks)**
#### May 6 - May 20
1. Test the system end-to-end with simulated data.
2. Fix bugs and optimize performance.
3. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Usage instructions.
   - API documentation.
   - Deployment guide.
4. Prepare a presentation/demo for the project.

## Milestone Goals
- **End of February**: Completed backend with data simulation and RESTful APIs.
- **End of March**: Functional front-end dashboard fetching and displaying data.
- **End of April**: Advanced features like predictive analytics and notifications.
- **Mid-May**: Polished system ready for demonstration.
